# Breast Cancer

This project contains data mining exercises and project work on a topic that arose from personal and professional interest, and attempts to answer the question "Is stage at diagnosis a predictor of breast cancer survival?"  Data used is from the NPCR and SEER-U.S. Cancer Statistics public use databases via an academic access request.  The dataset is over one million records/rows and is too large to import into Github.
